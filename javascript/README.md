#### Installation & Usage

Before starting the scripts make sure you have installed dependencies with `npm install` first.

Execute individual scripts with *node SCRIPT-NAME*. For example: *node ./app.js*.

Alternatively, scripts can be run with `npm run SCRIPT-NAME`. Check *package.json* for registered script names.


The *c-lightning* project must be executed with *lightningd*.
